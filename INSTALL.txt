If you want to get up and running as quick as possible, you will probably
be better off using the webstart version instead of this manual installation.

To run the webstart version, just point your browser to:

http://bookscanwizard.sourceforge.net/run


If you want to do this manually, follow the directions below.


--Prerequisites--

You will need to install the following before running the Book Scan Wizard:

Java 1.7

command arguments:

To get the list of command arguments, run
